# Application Name

#### By: Nick Tse

#### This project demonstrates use of Test Driven Development, development environments, and the Red, Green, Refactor workflow

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Jest
* webpack
* node package manager


## Description 

The project contains code that determines a user's age based on a planet's solar year. For instance, a solar year lasts 365 days on Earth. However, the length of a solar year on Mercury lasts for only 88 days. Therefore, your age on Mercury would be greater relative to your age on Earth, and this project calculates your age if you lived on different planets. 
* A Mercury year is .24 Earth years
* A Venus year is .62 Earth years
* A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years
* A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years

Furthermore, the project can calculate the user's life expectancy, and the number of years the user is expected to have left to live (or, if the user has surpassed their life expectancy, the project will tell the user the number of years they have lived beyond their life expectancy)
